Questions SAE assistants:


- Best practices "String/string" --> really just define as signature?
- Is it ok to change "Class" signature to abstract?
  --> if yes are we allowed to use enums instead?
- Does the person doing the booking have to fly with it too?
- Are Airport.code, Airline.name, Booking.ID, etc. unique? Must this be modeled?

new Important shit:
- not allowed that same person is twice in same booking or has two bookings for same flight.
